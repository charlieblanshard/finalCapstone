          I am 24 years old and live in London. I love food both making it and
          eating out and want to share these experiences with you. I am a
          pescetarian but mainly make vegetarian food.
        </p>

        <p>
          Encouraged by my mum at an early age to experiment, cooking whatever
          and whenever made me realise how adding in a different ingredient
          could totally change the taste my interest began then. Throughout
          university I got great pleasure cooking for friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          Excessive time during lockdown allowed me to experiment further, I
          found cooking relaxing and it allowed me to be creative. I would
          look forward to sharing my creations with my family. Mealtimes
          became a focus, it brought our family together even though we were
          crammed in the house. You can't beat socialising over a nice meal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now life in London gives me access to an array of ingredient. l love
          hosting dinner parties or knocking up a quick supper. My motto is it
          doesn‚Äôt matter what time or budget you have you can always make
          something delicious. I have also got into batch cooking this winter
          as a way of saving time and money whilst working. Check out my
          website, hope you enjoy my recipes.
